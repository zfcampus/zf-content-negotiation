## Introduction

`zf-content-negotiation` is a module for automating content negotiation tasks within a Zend
Framework application.

The following features are provided

- Mapping `Accept` header media types to specific view model types, and
  automatically casting controller results to those view model types.
- Defining `Accept` header media type whitelists; requests with `Accept` media types
  that fall outside the whitelist will be immediately rejected with a `406 Not
  Acceptable` response.
- Defining `Content-Type` header media type whitelists; requests sending content
  bodies with `Content-Type` media types that fall outside the whitelist will be
  immediately rejected with a `415 Unsupported Media Type` response.

## Requirements
  
Please see the [composer.json](composer.json) file.
 
## Installation

Run the following `composer` command:

```console
$ composer require zfcampus/zf-content-negotiation
```

Alternately, manually add the following to your `composer.json`, in the `require` section:

```javascript
"require": {
    "zfcampus/zf-content-negotiation": "^1.2"
}
```

And then run `composer update` to ensure the module is installed.

Finally, add the module name to your project's `config/application.config.php` under the `modules`
key:

```php
return [
    /* ... */
    'modules' => [
        /* ... */
        'ZF\ContentNegotiation',
    ],
    /* ... */
];
```

> ### zf-component-installer
>
> If you use [zf-component-installer](https://github.com/zendframework/zf-component-installer),
> that plugin will install zf-content-negotiation as a module for you.

## Configuration

### User Configuration

The top-level configuration key for user configuration of this module is `zf-content-negotiation`.

#### Key: `controllers`

The `controllers` key is utilized for mapping a content negotiation strategy to a particular
controller service name (from the top-level `controllers` section).  The value portion
of the controller array can either be a _named selector_ (see `selectors` below), or a
selector definition.

A selector definition consists of an array with the key of the array being the name of a view model,
and the value of it being an indexed array of media types that, when matched, will select that view
model.

Example:

```php
'controllers' => [
    // Named selector:
    'Application\Controller\HelloWorld1' => 'Json',

    // Selector definition:
    'Application\Controller\HelloWorld2' => [
        'ZF\ContentNegotiation\JsonModel' => [
            'application/json',
            'application/*+json',
        ],
    ],
],
```

#### Key: `selectors`

The `selectors` key is utilized to create named selector definitions for reuse between many different
controllers.  The key part of the selectors array will be a name used to correlate the selector
definition (which uses the format described in the [controllers](#key-controllers) key).

Example:

```php
'selectors' => [
    'Json' => [
        'ZF\ContentNegotiation\JsonModel' => [
            'application/json',
            'application/*+json',
        ],
    ],
],
```

A selector can contain multiple view models, each associated with different media types, allowing
you to provide multiple representations. As an example, the following selector would allow a given
controller to return either JSON or HTML output:

```php
'selectors' => [
    'HTML-Json' => [
        'ZF\ContentNegotiation\JsonModel' => [
            'application/json',
            'application/*+json',
        ],
        'ZF\ContentNegotiation\ViewModel' => [
            'text/html',            
        ],
    ],
],
```

#### Key: `accept_whitelist`

The `accept_whitelist` key is utilized to instruct the content negotiation module which media types
are acceptable for a given controller service name. When a controller service name is configured
in this key, along with an indexed array of matching media types, only media types that match
the `Accept` header of a given request will be allowed to be dispatched.  Unmatched media types
will receive a `406 Cannot honor Accept type specified` response.

The value of each controller service name key can either be a string or an array of strings.

Example:

```php
'accept_whitelist' => [
    'Application\\Controller\\HelloApiController' => [
        'application/vnd.application-hello+json',
        'application/hal+json',
        'application/json',
    ],
],
```

#### Key: `content_type_whitelist`

The `content_type_whitelist` key is utilized to instruct the content negotiation module which media
types are valid for the `Content-Type` of a request.  When a controller service name is
configured in this key, along with an indexed array of matching media types, only media types
that match the `Content-Type` header of a given request will be allowed to be dispatched. Unmatched
media types will receive a `415 Invalid content-type specified` response.

The value of each controller service name key can either be a string or an array of strings.

Example:

```php
'content_type_whitelist' => [
    'Application\\Controller\\HelloWorldController' => [
        'application/vnd.application-hello-world+json',
        'application/json',
    ],
],
```

#### Key: `x_http_method_override_enabled`

- Since 1.3.0

This boolean flag determines whether or not the `HttpMethodOverrideListener`
will be enabled by default.

#### Key: `http_override_methods`

- Since 1.3.0

The `http_override_methods` key is utilized to provide the
`HttpMethodOverrideListener` with a map of allowed override methods for a given
HTTP method, as specified via the `X-HTTP-Method-Override` header. Essentially,
the values are:

```php
'Incoming HTTP request method' => $arrayOfAllowedOverrideMethods,
```

As an example, if you want to allow the `X-HTTP-Method-Override` header to allow
overriding HTTP `GET` requests with an alternate method, you might define this
as follows:

```php
'x_http_method_override_enabled' => true,
'http_override_methods' => [
    'GET' => [
        'HEAD',
        'POST',
        'PUT',
        'DELETE',
        'PATCH',
    ],
];
```

Then, to make a request, you could do the following:

```http
GET /foo HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
X-HTTP-Method-Override: PATCH

some=content&more=content
```

The above would then be interpreted as a `PATCH` request. If the same request
were made via HTTP `POST`, or if a `GET` request were made with an override
value of `OPTIONS`, the listener would raise a problem, as, in the former case,
no maps are defined for `POST`, and, in the latter, `OPTIONS` is not in the map
for `GET`.

## ZF Events

### Listeners

#### ZF\ContentNegotiation\AcceptListener

This listener is attached to the `MvcEvent::EVENT_DISPATCH` event with priority `-10`.  It is
responsible for performing the actual selection and casting of a controller's view model based on
the content negotiation configuration.

#### ZF\ContentNegotiation\ContentTypeListener

This listener is attached to the `MvcEvent::EVENT_ROUTE` event with a priority of `-625`. It is
responsible for examining the `Content-Type` header in order to determine how the content body
should be deserialized. Values are then persisted inside of a `ParameterDataContainer` which is
stored in the `ZFContentNegotiationParameterData` key of the `MvcEvent` object.

#### ZF\ContentNegotiation\AcceptFilterListener

This listener is attached to the `MvcEvent::EVENT_ROUTE` event with a priority of `-625`. It is
responsible for ensuring the controller selected by routing is configured to respond to the specific
media type in the current request's `Accept` header.  If it cannot, it will short-circuit the MVC
dispatch process by returning a `406 Cannot honor Accept type specified` response.

#### ZF\ContentNegotiation\ContentTypeFilterListener

This listener is attached to the `MvcEvent::EVENT_ROUTE` event with a priority of `-625`. It is
responsible for ensuring the route matched controller can accept content in the request body
specified by the media type in the current request's `Content-Type` header. If it cannot, it will
short-circuit the MVC dispatch process by returning a `415 Invalid content-type specified` response.

#### ZF\ContentNegotiation\HttpMethodOverrideListener

- Since 1.3.0

This listener is attached to the `MvcEvent::EVENT_ROUTE` event with a priority
of `-40`, but only if the `x_http_method_override_enabled` configuration flag
was toggle on. It is responsible for checking if an `X-HTTP-Method-Override`
header is present, and, if so, if it contains a value in the set allowed for the
current HTTP request method invoked. If so, it resets the HTTP request method to
the header value.

## ZF Services

### Controller Plugins

#### ZF\ContentNegotiation\ControllerPlugin\RouteParam (a.k.a "routeParam")
